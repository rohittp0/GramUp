## What is GramUp?

**GramUp** is a lightweight python program to backup your files. **GramUp** enables you unlimited cloud backup and easy restore functionality and that too for free. With **GramUp,** monthly bills for cloud storage will be a thing of the past. 

##  How does it work?

**GramUp** uses Telegram's unlimited cloud storage for backup. All your files are stored on Telegram servers and secured by their encryption. You can select a chat ( usually saved messages ) to use and **GramUp** will send all files to that chat and later at an event of restoration download files from there. Since both Telegram and **GramUp** are opensource you don't have to worry about someday suddenly you having to pay for your storage.
